* The tool

    HDF dump extracts a scientific data set (SDS), or a part of it, from
    an HDF file, optionally applying `scale_factor' and `add_offset' SDS
    attributes.  The result could be requested in either raw, text or
    machine-dependend floating-point representation.

    This tool allows to use HDF SDS data as input for tools, designed to
    operate on ASCII (text) or raw (binary) data. It complements
    standard HDF `hdp' tool in the following ways:

     * attributes `scale_factor' and `add_offset' are taken into account
       when dumping an SDS; if they're incorrect, they could be
       overriden by the corresponding command line options;

     * the data could be dumped in ASCII (text) or raw (binary; the same
       form as stored in the HDF file) form, as well as in a form of
       single- or double-precision machine-specific floating point
       numbers (C types float and double are supported);

     * GNU long options are supported, allowing for better
       self-describing Shell code.
