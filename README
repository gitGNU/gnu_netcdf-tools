* What are NetCDF tools?

	The NetCDF tools are a few tools to operate on NetCDF and, by
	utilizing the compatibility API, HDF4 files, and intended to be
	used from the Shell scripts.

	The NetCDF tools package is currently comprised of a couple of
	simplistic Shell wrappers over the respective NetCDF functions
	(ncattget and ncattput), and a more sophisticated ncget tool.

* History

	The simplistic ncattget and ncattput tools were written by Ivan
	Shmakov in November, 2009.
