BUGS  -*- Text -*-

	In the list below, the bug listed for a NetCDF command is also
	present in its HDF4 (COMMAND-hdf) counterpart, unless said
	otherwise.

	When the output format for ncget is set to either float or
        double, the programs are subject to the RLIMIT_STACK resource
        limit.  Please ensure that the programs are run within an
        environment with this limit set high enough to contain the whole
        set of data requested in the target (that is, float or double)
        representation.  Elsewhere the programs may catch SIGSEGV.

	ncget should support a wider set of binary representations for
        output (in particular, the integer ones ranging from int8_t and
        uint8_t to int64_t and uint64_t should be supported, but also
        long double.)  Please look at lib/numconv.c in the source for
        the details.

	The ncget command line options should generally match those
	supported by the (yet to be released) Rawtools package.

	There ought to be a more general ncput command.

	Please report bugs to adir-devel@theory.asu.ru.
