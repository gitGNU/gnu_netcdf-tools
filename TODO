TODO  -*- Text -*-

* Documentation.

* Check for ``FIXME'' markers all along the code.  In particular, allow
  for the location of the HDF4 version of netcdf.h to be specified
  explicitly.

* Add ``buffer management'' for ncget.  E. g., extracting a large single
  part of an NetCDF variable (HDF4 SDS) requires a buffer in the virtual
  memory as large as the part to be extracted, while a smaller buffer
  could be used just as well at the expense of having to make more calls
  to ncvarget ().

* Allow the NetCDF ``type'' to be specified for `ncattput'.  Allow for
  representation conversions.

* Drop ncattget, since ncget apparently does everything ncattget does?

* Implement ncput.  Drop ncattput then?
